# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone - Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction ðŸš€

This repository contains my work for the **IBM Applied Data Science Capstone** project. In this project, we aim to predict the success of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing, providing valuable insight into the potential costs of a launch. SpaceX advertises the cost of a Falcon 9 rocket launch as approximately $62 million, significantly less than other providers, whose costs range upward of $165 million. Much of SpaceX's savings come from the reuse of the first stage, making the prediction of a successful landing a crucial aspect in determining launch costs. This information could be useful for potential competitors bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this capstone project is to leverage data science methodologies to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Specifically, this project covers the following:

- Data collection, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis.
- Feature engineering and model development to make predictions.
- Business analysis to assess the impact of predictions.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes several Jupyter notebooks documenting the different stages of the project:

1. **Data Collection and Wrangling**: Collects the relevant data from multiple sources, processes it, and handles missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducts an in-depth exploration of the dataset, finding trends and insights that guide the model-building process.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features that are most predictive of a successful landing.
4. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Develops machine learning models to predict landing outcomes and evaluates their performance.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Builds an interactive dashboard to visualize the data and predictions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for all code development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model building and evaluation.
